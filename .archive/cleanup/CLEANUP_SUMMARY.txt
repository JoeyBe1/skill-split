SKILL-SPLIT DOCUMENTATION CLEANUP ANALYSIS
===========================================
Date: 2026-02-06
Status: ANALYSIS COMPLETE - READY FOR APPROVAL

==================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
==================================================

The skill-split project has accumulated 62 Markdown files from 6 development
waves and 14 phases. Most are development artifacts valuable for history but
not needed for user-facing documentation.

PROPOSED ACTION:
  - Keep 18 files (29%) as user-facing documentation
  - Archive 44 files (71%) to .archive/ directory
  - Create documentation index for easy navigation
  - Preserve all history in organized archive structure

BENEFITS:
  ✓ Cleaner, less confusing documentation for new users
  ✓ All development history preserved and organized
  ✓ Easy recovery if archived docs are needed again
  ✓ Clear separation of "what to read" vs "historical context"
  ✓ Reduced cognitive load for new contributors

EFFORT: ~15 minutes to execute once approved

  Location: .archive/user-guides/


==================================================
GAP ANALYSIS
==================================================

Strengths of Kept Documentation
  ✓ README.md provides good feature overview
  ✓ EXAMPLES.md has concrete usage scenarios
  ✓ COMPONENT_HANDLERS.md explains architecture well
  ✓ DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md tracks production readiness
  ✓ Feature guides cover main workflows

Identified Gaps (Optional - Only if Needed)
  ⚠ Quick Start section (can enhance README.md)
  ❌ Troubleshooting guide (create if issues emerge)
  ⚠ Formal API reference (can extract from docstrings)
  ❌ Architecture diagram (can add ASCII diagram to CLAUDE.md)
  ⚠ Migration path documentation (can add to DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)

Recommendation:
  Don't create docs preemptively. Monitor usage patterns and create docs
  only when users ask questions. Prefer to enhance existing docs rather
  than create new ones.

==================================================
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
==================================================

Phase 1: Create Archive Directories
  Command: mkdir -p .archive/{wave-reports,phase-plans,task-reports,
                               testing-docs,test-reports,investigations,
                               strategy-docs,user-guides}

Phase 2: Move Files to Archive (44 files total)
  • Wave reports (8 files) → .archive/wave-reports/
  • Phase plans (9 files) → .archive/phase-plans/
  • Task reports (5 files) → .archive/task-reports/
  • Roundtrip tests (6 files) → .archive/testing-docs/
  • Test reports (4 files) → .archive/test-reports/
  • Investigations (8 files) → .archive/investigations/
  • Strategy docs (4 files) → .archive/strategy-docs/
  • User guides (5 files) → .archive/user-guides/

Phase 3: Create Documentation Index
  Files created:
  • DOCUMENTATION.md - Quick reference for all docs
  • .archive/README.md - Archive index
  • .cleanup-manifest.txt - This manifest

Phase 4: Verify and Commit
  • Verify all 18 kept docs are in root
  • Test that all links work
  • Update CLAUDE.md "Files Created" section
  • Commit: "refactor(docs): archive development history, add documentation index"

Time Estimate: 15 minutes to execute


==================================================
KEY DECISIONS & RATIONALE
==================================================

Why Keep 18 Docs?
  These 18 docs serve specific purposes for users or developers:
  - 7 docs guide usage (README, EXAMPLES, features, setup)
  - 3 docs provide architecture (CLAUDE, COMPONENT_HANDLERS, INTEGRATION)
  - 4 docs are operational (DEPLOYMENT_*, MIGRATION, MANUAL_TEST)
  - 4 docs are internal rules (CODEX, AGENT, references)

Why Archive 44 Docs?
  These are all development artifacts:
  - Phase/wave/task reports are historical records
  - Test and roundtrip reports are QA history
  - Investigation docs are past problem-solving
  - Strategy docs are captured in core docs
  - User guides are personal or tool-specific

Why Keep Development History?
  - Helps understand design evolution
  - Useful for troubleshooting past issues
  - Reference for similar future problems
  - Shows project maturity and testing rigor
  - Can restore if needed

Why Not Create New Docs?
  - Don't create preemptively
  - Wait for real user questions
  - Add to existing docs when possible
  - Only create docs with clear use cases


==================================================
BEFORE/AFTER COMPARISON
==================================================

BEFORE CLEANUP:
  62 MD files in root directory
  Users see lots of wave/phase/task reports
  Hard to know what to read first
  Cognitive load: HIGH
  Clutter: HIGH

AFTER CLEANUP:
  18 MD files in root directory
  Users see only essential documentation
  Clear navigation via DOCUMENTATION.md
  Archive contains full history
  Cognitive load: LOW
  Clutter: LOW
  Organization: CLEAR


==================================================
ROLLBACK PLAN
==================================================

If cleanup needs to be reversed:
  1. All 44 files preserved in .archive/
  2. Can be moved back to root in minutes
  3. .cleanup-manifest.txt contains exact file list
  4. No data loss, fully reversible

To restore a specific doc:
  Example: mv .archive/wave-reports/WAVE_3_CODE_REFERENCE.md ./

To restore all:
  for dir in .archive/*/; do mv "$dir"*.md .; done


==================================================
APPROVAL CHECKLIST
==================================================

Before proceeding, confirm:

□ Analysis is comprehensive (all 62 files categorized)
□ Categorization is logical (8 archive subdirectories)
□ Gap analysis identifies real needs (optional docs)
□ Implementation plan is clear and low-risk
□ Rollback plan is documented and easy
□ Effort estimate is reasonable (15 minutes)
□ New docs (DOCUMENTATION.md) add value
□ Archive structure is organized and discoverable
□ No files are lost or deleted (all preserved)


==================================================
CREATED ARTIFACTS
==================================================

This analysis created 3 reference documents:

1. CLEANUP_PLAN.md
   - Comprehensive plan with all details
   - Categorization of all 62 files
   - Implementation steps
   - Gap analysis
   - Future doc recommendations

2. DOCUMENTATION.md
   - Quick navigation index for all docs
   - Organized by role (user, operator, developer)
   - Links to all 18 kept docs
   - Archive reference

3. .cleanup-manifest.txt
   - Flat list of all 62 files with categories
   - Exact move commands
   - Summary statistics
   - Manifest for verification

Plus this summary for quick review.


==================================================
NEXT STEPS
==================================================

If approved:
  1. Read CLEANUP_PLAN.md for full details
  2. Review .cleanup-manifest.txt for exact files
  3. Execute Phase 1-4 implementation steps
