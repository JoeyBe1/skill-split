Complete and Ready for Review
================================================================================

Date: 2026-02-06
Status: ANALYSIS COMPLETE
Artifacts Created: 4 comprehensive planning documents

================================================================================
WHAT WAS ANALYZED
================================================================================

Total Files Examined: 62 Markdown documentation files

File Locations:
  • Root directory: 50+ MD files
  • migrations/: 1 MD file (SCHEMA_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
  • test/: 1 MD file (MANUAL_ROUNDTRIP_TEST.md)
  • docs/: 1 MD file (VECTOR_SEARCH_COSTS.md)
  • demo/: 1 MD file (sample_skill.md)
  • .pytest_cache/: 1 MD file (auto-generated)

Timespan: Waves 1-8, Phases 1-14 of development


================================================================================
ANALYSIS RESULTS
================================================================================

KEEP (18 files) - User-Facing Documentation
  ├── Core: README.md, CLAUDE.md, CODEX.md, AGENT.md
  ├── Usage: EXAMPLES.md, DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md, DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
  ├── Features: 6 feature guides (components, handlers, search, etc)
  ├── References: 4 technical references (migrations, testing, costs, samples)
  └── New: DOCUMENTATION.md (navigation index)

ARCHIVE (44 files) - Development History
  ├── Wave Reports (8)       → .archive/wave-reports/

  Optional: Formal API reference (extract from code)
  Recommendation: Create docs reactively, not proactively


================================================================================
BEFORE vs AFTER
================================================================================

BEFORE CLEANUP
──────────────
Root Directory:
  62 Markdown files
  Includes: Wave reports, phase plans, task lists, test reports,
            investigations, strategy docs, user guides

User Experience:
  • New users see 62 files
  • Hard to know what to read first
  • Cognitive load: VERY HIGH
  • "What is this project?" takes 30 minutes

AFTER CLEANUP
─────────────
Root Directory:
  18 Markdown files
  Only: User guides, feature docs, deployment info, examples

Archive Directory (.archive/):
  44 organized files in 8 subdirectories
  Full development history preserved

User Experience:
  • New users see 18 files
  • Clear what to read: README → DOCUMENTATION.md
  • Cognitive load: LOW
  • "What is this project?" takes 5 minutes

Git Repository:
  • Same file count (no deletions)
  • Better organized structure
  • Cleaner root directory
  • Easier navigation
  • History preserved for reference


================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
================================================================================

Execution Steps:
  1. Create archive directory structure (1 command)
  2. Move 44 files to archive subdirectories (8 move commands)
  3. Create .archive/README.md with index
  4. Verify structure and test links
  5. Commit with message: "refactor(docs): archive development history"

Time Estimate: 15 minutes total

Risk Level: LOW
  • All files preserved (nothing deleted)
  • No breaking changes
  • Easy to rollback (git revert)
  • Reversible (can move files back)

Rollback:
  Option 1: git revert [commit hash]
  Option 2: for dir in .archive/*/; do mv "$dir"*.md .; done


================================================================================

================================================================================
USAGE GUIDE
================================================================================

For Joey to Review:
  1. Read CLEANUP_SUMMARY.txt (5 min) - Executive overview

  3. Review DOCUMENTATION.md (2 min) - New navigation structure
  4. Decide: approve or request changes

For Implementation:
  1. Execute steps in .CLEANUP_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
  2. Or use exact commands from .cleanup-manifest.txt
  3. Verify: ls -la shows 18 MD files in root
  4. Verify: ls .archive/*/ shows 44 files in 8 subdirectories
  5. Test: Check links in DOCUMENTATION.md
  6. Commit: Use provided commit message

For Future Reference:
  • All 4 planning documents kept in root directory
  • Archive index at .archive/README.md
  • Manifest at .cleanup-manifest.txt
  • Quick reference at .CLEANUP_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
