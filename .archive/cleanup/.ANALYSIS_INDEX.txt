================================================================================
DECISION FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

Approve If You Agree:
  ✓ New users are confused by 62 docs
  ✓ 18 user-facing docs is better
  ✓ Development history should be archived
  ✓ .archive/ is good way to organize history
  ✓ Implementation is low-risk
  ✓ DOCUMENTATION.md helps navigation

Request Changes If:
  ✗ Some files should stay in root
  ✗ Archive organization doesn't make sense
  ✗ Different categorization preferred
  ✗ Concerned about any rollback scenario

Defer If:
  ? Need more time to review
  ? Want to discuss with team
  ? Want to sleep on it


================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

Step 1: Review
  → Read CLEANUP_SUMMARY.txt (5 min)
  → Read CLEANUP_PLAN.md (10 min)
  → Review DOCUMENTATION.md (3 min)

Step 2: Decide
  → Approve as-is
  → Request specific changes
  → Defer for further discussion

Step 3: If Approved, Execute
  → Use .CLEANUP_QUICK_REFERENCE.md for 4-step process
  → Or use .cleanup-manifest.txt for exact commands
  → Test with: ls -la | grep "\.md$" | wc -l (should show 18)

Step 4: Verify & Commit
  → Check structure: ls .archive/*/
  → Test links: grep -r "\[.*\](.*\.md)" DOCUMENTATION.md
  → Commit: git commit -m "refactor(docs): archive development history"

================================================================================
QUESTIONS?
================================================================================

Q: What if I don't like the archive organization?
A: Easy to change - see CLEANUP_PLAN.md for all categories with rationale

Q: What if I want to keep some archived files in root?
A: Simple - just don't move them (can edit .cleanup-manifest.txt)

Q: How do I undo the cleanup if something goes wrong?
A: Two options:
   1. git revert [commit hash]
   2. for dir in .archive/*/; do mv "$dir"*.md .; done

Q: Will this break anything?
A: No - only doc organization changes. Code is untouched.

Q: How long does implementation take?
A: ~15 minutes total (create dirs, move files, test)

Q: Can I do this incrementally?
A: Yes - you can move categories one at a time

Q: What about future documentation?
A: Keep new docs in root (unless it's a new development artifact)
