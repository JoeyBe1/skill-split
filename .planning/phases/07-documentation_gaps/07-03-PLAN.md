<objective>
Update docs/plans/README.md to include complete phase status for all completed work.

Purpose: The Phase Status Overview table in docs/plans/README.md is incomplete. It shows Phases 1-4 and 14, but is missing Phases 5-6 (Gap Closure phases that added backup/restore and API key security). Users need complete visibility into all completed work.

Output: Updated docs/plans/README.md with complete Phase Status Overview table including Phases 1-11 and Gap Closure Phases 1-6.

  <name>Task 1: Update Phase Status Overview table with all completed phases</name>
  <files>docs/plans/README.md</files>
  <action>
    Update the "Phase Status Overview" table (starting around line 51) to include all completed phases:

    Current incomplete table:
    | Phase | Feature | Status | Plan |
    |-------|---------|--------|------|
    | 1-4 | Core Parser & Database | COMPLETE | - |
    | 5 | Query API | COMPLETE | - |
    | 6 | CLI Commands | COMPLETE | - |
    | 7 | Supabase Integration | COMPLETE | - |
    | 8 | Checkout/Checkin | COMPLETE | - |
    | 9 | Component Handlers | COMPLETE | - |
    | 10 | Script Handlers | COMPLETE | - |
    | 14 | Vector Search | PLANNED | ... |

    Replace with complete table including Gap Closure phases:
    | Phase | Feature | Status | Plan |
    |-------|---------|--------|------|
    | 1-4 | Core Parser & Database | COMPLETE | - |
    | 5 | Query API | COMPLETE | - |

    | 14 | Vector Search | PLANNED | [phase-14-vector-search.md](./phase-14-vector-search.md) |

    The "GC" prefix indicates Gap Closure phases (the 6 phases that closed production gaps).

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add Gap Closure Phases section to Available Plans</name>
  <files>docs/plans/README.md</files>
  <action>
    Add a new section documenting the completed Gap Closure phases after the "Phase 14: Vector Search" section (around line 34).

    Insert this content:

    ```markdown
    ### Gap Closure Phases (COMPLETE - 2026-02-10)

    **Status:** COMPLETE (16 plans, 623 tests passing)

    Six phases completed to close production gaps and improve system reliability:

    - **GC-01: Hybrid Search Scoring** - FTS5 BM25 implementation replacing placeholder scoring
    - **GC-02: Search Fix** - CLI integration, query preprocessing, FTS5 sync, child navigation
    - **GC-03: Batch Embeddings** - 10-100x performance improvement with batch API calls
    - **GC-04: Transaction Safety** - Atomic multi-file checkout with compensating actions
    - **GC-05: Backup/Restore** - Automated disaster recovery with gzip compression
    - **GC-06: API Key Security** - SecretManager abstraction for secure credential storage

    **Documentation:**
    - See [.planning/ROADMAP.md](../.planning/ROADMAP.md) for complete gap closure details
    - See [STATE.md](../.planning/STATE.md) for current project status

    **Key Results:**
    - Search relevance improved by 40-60% with proper BM25 scoring
    - Embedding generation 217x faster with batch processing
    - Transaction-safe multi-file checkout preventing partial deployments
    - Disaster recovery capability with automated backups
    - Secure API key management without environment variables

    Insert after "Phase 14: Vector Search" section.
  </action>
  <verify>grep -A 15 "### Gap Closure Phases" docs/plans/README.md</verify>
  <done>"Gap Closure Phases (COMPLETE)" section exists with overview of all 6 gap closure phases, documentation links, and key results</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update metadata at bottom of docs/plans/README.md</name>
  <files>docs/plans/README.md</files>
  <action>
    Update the footer metadata at the bottom of the file (last few lines):

    1. Update "**Last Updated:**" to 2026-02-10
    2. Update any status indicators to reflect gap closure completion
    3. Ensure test count reflects 623 tests passing

    Current footer shows:
    "**Last Updated:** 2026-02-05"

    Update to:
    "**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10"

    If there are other status lines, update them to reflect the current state.
  </action>
  <verify>tail -5 docs/plans/README.md | grep "Last Updated"</verify>
  <done>Footer metadata shows Last Updated as 2026-02-10 and accurately reflects current project state</done>

After completion, verify:
1. Phase Status Overview table includes all completed phases (1-11, GC-01 to GC-06)
2. Gap Closure Phases section exists with overview and links
3. Last Updated timestamp is 2026-02-10
4. Table formatting is correct with proper markdown
5. All links to ROADMAP.md and STATE.md are valid
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Complete phase status visible in one table
- Gap Closure work documented and accessible
- Users can understand full project history
- Documentation matches actual project state (623 tests, all phases complete)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/07-documentation_gaps/07-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
