<objective>
Update README.md with backup and restore command documentation.

Purpose: Users need complete CLI reference documentation for the backup and restore commands implemented in Phase 05. The README currently shows 518 tests but should reflect 623 tests after all phases.

Output: Updated README.md with backup/restore CLI reference, updated test count to 623.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add backup command documentation to README CLI Reference</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
    Add a new CLI Reference section for the backup command after the existing Search Command section.

    The backup command section should include:
    - Command syntax: `./skill_split.py backup [--output <path>] [--db <path>]`
    - Description: Creates timestamped, gzip-compressed SQLite dump of database
    - Arguments table with --output, --db flags
    - Usage examples showing basic backup and custom filename
    - Notes about backup location (default: ~/.claude/backups/)
    - Mention of FTS5 virtual table handling and gzip compression

    Insert after line 315 (after Search Command section, before "---" separator).

    Format to match existing CLI reference sections (see Store Command, Search Command for style).
  </action>
  <verify>grep -A 20 "### Backup Command" README.md | head -25</verify>
  <done>"### Backup Command" section exists in README.md with complete documentation including syntax, description, arguments, examples, and notes</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add restore command documentation to README CLI Reference</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
    Add a new CLI Reference section for the restore command immediately after the backup command section.

    The restore command section should include:
    - Command syntax: `./skill_split.py restore <backup_file> [--db <path>] [--overwrite]`
    - Description: Restores database from backup file with integrity validation
    - Arguments table with backup_file, --db, --overwrite flags
    - Usage examples showing basic restore and overwrite scenario
    - Notes about --overwrite protection and integrity_check validation
    - Return value mention (records_restored, tables_restored, integrity_check_passed)

    Insert immediately after the Backup Command section added in Task 1.
  </action>
  <verify>grep -A 20 "### Restore Command" README.md | head -25</verify>
  <done>"### Restore Command" section exists in README.md with complete documentation including syntax, description, arguments, examples, notes about --overwrite flag and integrity validation</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update test count from 518 to 623 in README.md</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
    Find all instances of "518 tests" in README.md and update to "623 tests" to reflect the current test count after all phases.

    Search for: "518 tests"
    Replace with: "623 tests"

    Also check for "518 tests passing" or similar variations and update accordingly.

    The test count appears in:
    - Testing section under "Current Test Count" (around line 813)
    - Any other locations where test count is mentioned

    Ensure all references are updated consistently.
  </action>
  <verify>grep -n "tests" README.md | grep -E "(623|518)"</verify>
  <done>All instances of "518 tests" updated to "623 tests" throughout README.md, no remaining references to old test count</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 4: Update Last Updated timestamp in README.md</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
    Update the "Last Updated" timestamp at the bottom of README.md to reflect the documentation update.

    Find the line near the end:
    "**Last Updated**: 2026-02-08"

    Update to:
    "**Last Updated**: 2026-02-10"

    Also update the Status line to reflect all 6 phases complete:
    Change "Next: Phase 02" or similar to indicate all phases complete.

    Update to:
    "**Status**: Phases 1-6 Complete (623 tests passing)"
  </action>
  <verify>grep "Last Updated" README.md | tail -1</verify>
  <done>README.md Last Updated shows 2026-02-10, Status line reflects Phases 1-6 Complete with 623 tests passing</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After completion, verify:
1. README.md has both "### Backup Command" and "### Restore Command" sections
2. Both sections include syntax, description, arguments, examples, and notes
3. Test count shows 623 throughout the document
4. Last Updated timestamp is 2026-02-10
5. Status line reflects all 6 phases complete
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- README.md documents backup and restore commands completely
- Test count updated to 623
- Last Updated timestamp is current
- All CLI commands are documented
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/07-documentation_gaps/07-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
