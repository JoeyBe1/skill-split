## PR Title

```
Add skill-split: section-level SQLite library for Claude Code skills
```

---

## PR Body

```
## What this adds

- [skill-split](https://github.com/JoeyBe1/skill-split) - Section-level SQLite library for Claude Code skills. Search, checkout, and compose any section of any skill/command/plugin with 99% token savings.

## Why it belongs here

skill-split directly enhances Claude Code's skill/command ecosystem by making large skill libraries navigable at the section level. Instead of loading full 21KB files into context, agents can search, retrieve, and compose individual sections (200 bytes each). It handles skills, commands, plugins, hooks, and scripts.

## Category suggestion

Add under the **Tools** or **Utilities** section (or whichever section covers Claude Code developer tooling).
