Add skill-split: section-level SQLite library for Claude Code skills
```

---

## PR Body

```
## What this adds

- [skill-split](https://github.com/JoeyBe1/skill-split) - Section-level SQLite library for Claude Code skills. Search, checkout, and compose any section of any skill/command/plugin with 99% token savings.

## Why it belongs here

skill-split is directly relevant to Claude Code skill management. It provides a SQLite-backed library for storing, searching, and deploying skills at the section level — letting you retrieve exactly the section of a skill you need (200 bytes) instead of the full file (21KB+). Supports skills, commands, plugins, hooks, and scripts.

## Category suggestion

Add under the **Tools** section, or whichever category covers skill management utilities.
