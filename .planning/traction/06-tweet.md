## Tweet 1 (Hook)

```
Loading full 21KB skill files into Claude Code every session?

I reduced that to ~200 bytes per query.

99% token savings — here's how:

## Tweet 2 (What it does)

```
skill-split stores every section of every skill, command, and plugin in SQLite.

Search returns the exact section you need (not the whole file).
Check it out. Compose new skills from sections across files.

Works on 19,207 sections across 1,365 files. Byte-perfect round-trip.

## Tweet 3 (Link + tags)

```
Fully local. BM25 keyword search out of the box.
Optional semantic/hybrid search with embeddings.

## Thread Notes

- Post tweets in rapid succession as a thread (reply to each)
- Tweet 1 is the hook — do not include the link here
- The gap between tweet 1 and 2 is intentional: creates a pause before the reveal
- Consider pinning this thread to your profile after posting
- If engagement picks up, quote-tweet with the demo GIF once recorded
- Optimal posting time: Tuesday–Thursday, 9am–11am in your timezone
